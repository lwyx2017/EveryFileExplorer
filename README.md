# Every File Explorer

## This project is a continuation of Gericom's original project https://github.com/Gericom/EveryFileExplorer

### Describe
I really like this tool, But the original author abandoned the development around 2015.
Around 2017, I began experimenting with modifications in [This branch](https://github.com/lwyx2016/EveryFileExplorer), But I implemented fewer features and added a lot of unnecessary code, Later, due to losing the recovery key, I could no longer access this old account.

Now, I have created this new branch and hope to make some improvements and maintenance within my capabilities when I have time. This branch has exited the Fork network, because in the past someone submitted a PR with my low-quality code to the original author, which is bad!

### Please note
My programming skills are limited, significant updates are unlikely.
Many new features are experimental and may be unstable or incomplete.
This is personal test experimental project, not an official version, For reliable and full functionality, please consider using other, more mature tools.

### Build
The project has been migrated to .NET Framework 4.8, The solution already Add Reference the required libraries and can be opened and compiled directly in Visual Studio 2022.

### Credits
I will thanks to the creators of these open-source projects, Because I reference to some of their implementation specifications, To attempt to implement similar functionality in EFE
